RSA encryption + MAC authentication

global public key = RSA.publickey()

Sender 
    MACkey = H(global public key) // 128-bit
    Tag = MAC(msg, MACkey)

    sender.publickey = RSA.publickey()
    sender.privatekey = RSA.privatekey()

    Payload = ENC(msg||tag, receiver.publickey()) // being concantinate

** Payload to receiver 

Receiver 
    payload_receiver = DEC(payload, receiver.privatekey())

    // we know that payload_receiver = msg + tag
    // we can split the payload_receiver into receiver_msg and receiver_tag

    MACkey = H(global public key)
    Tag = MAC(receiver_msg, MACkey)

    if Tag == MAC(msg, MACkey)
        return true
    else
        // discard the message

Note: I use a global public key to make sure that it will be the across the vehicle, we don't to worry about the other peole knowing the MACkey, cause the mesage is being encrypt

Still have bug
